The Ruby OCR SDK supports the [W9 API](https://platform.mindee.com/mindee/us_w9).

Using the [sample below](https://github.com/mindee/client-lib-test-data/blob/main/products/us_w9/default_sample.jpg), we are going to illustrate how to extract the data that we want using the OCR SDK.
![W9 sample](https://github.com/mindee/client-lib-test-data/blob/main/products/us_w9/default_sample.jpg?raw=true)

# Quick-Start
```rb
require 'mindee'

# Init a new client
mindee_client = Mindee::Client.new(api_key: 'my-api-key')

# Load a file from disk
input_source = mindee_client.source_from_path('/path/to/the/file.ext')

# Parse the file
result = mindee_client.parse(
  input_source,
  Mindee::Product::US::W9::W9V1
)

# Print a full summary of the parsed data in RST format
puts result.document
```

**Output (RST):**
```rst

# Field Types
## Standard Fields
These fields are generic and used in several products.

### Basic Field
Each prediction object contains a set of fields that inherit from the generic `Field` class.
A typical `Field` object will have the following attributes:

* **value** (`String`, `Float`, `Integer`, `Boolean`): corresponds to the field value. Can be `nil` if no value was extracted.
* **confidence** (Float, nil): the confidence score of the field prediction.
* **bounding_box** (`Mindee::Geometry::Quadrilateral`, `nil`): contains exactly 4 relative vertices (points) coordinates of a right rectangle containing the field in the document.
* **polygon** (`Mindee::Geometry::Polygon`, `nil`): contains the relative vertices coordinates (`Point`) of a polygon containing the field in the image.
* **page_id** (`Integer`, `nil`): the ID of the page, always `nil` when at document-level.
* **reconstructed** (`Boolean`): indicates whether an object was reconstructed (not extracted as the API gave it).


Aside from the previous attributes, all basic fields have access to a `to_s` method that can be used to print their value as a string.


### Position Field
The position field `PositionField` does not implement all the basic `Field` attributes, only **bounding_box**, **polygon** and **page_id**. On top of these, it has access to:

* **rectangle** (`Mindee::Geometry::Quadrilateral`): a Polygon with four points that may be oriented (even beyond canvas).
* **quadrangle** (`Mindee::Geometry::Quadrilateral`): a free polygon made up of four points.

### String Field
The text field `StringField` only has one constraint: it's **value** is a `String` (or `nil`).

## Page-Level Fields
Some fields are constrained to the page level, and so will not be retrievable at document level.

# Attributes
