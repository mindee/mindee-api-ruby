# Mindee API Helper Library for Ruby
Quickly and easily connect to Mindee's API services using Ruby.

## Quick Start
Here's the TL;DR of getting started.

First, get an [API Key](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/make-your-first-request#create-an-api-key)

Install by adding this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mindee'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mindee

Finally, Ruby away!

### Off-the-Shelf Document
```ruby
require 'mindee'

# Init a new client and configure the Invoice API
mindee_client = Mindee::Client.new.config_invoice(api_key: 'my-invoice-api-key')

# Load a file from disk and parse it
api_response = mindee_client.doc_from_path("/path/to/the/invoice.pdf").parse("invoice")

# Print a brief summary of the parsed data
puts api_response.document
```

### Custom Document (API Builder)
```ruby
require 'mindee'

# Init a new client and configure your custom document
mindee_client = Mindee::Client.new.config_custom_doc(
  'pokemon-card',
  'pikachu',
  api_key: 'pokemon-card-api-key'
)

# Load a file from disk and parse it
api_response = mindee_client.doc_from_path("/path/to/the/card.jpg").parse("pokemon-card")

# Print a brief summary of the parsed data
puts api_response.document
```
